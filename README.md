# BobDotBot
BobDotBot is a discord bot made in python 3 using discord.py. It has many features, so you dont have to have many bots in your server just to get the commands that you want. It is always being improved, so if you see a bug or have a suggestion, dont hesitate to use the report bug or suggest commands to contact the devloper. It is always online, so no need to worry about it going offline randomly

## Source Code
All of the old tokens in the source code have been regenerated, and will not work anymore. Also, most of the old code that I had made is pretty bad, as I wrote it at the beginning of learning the programming language. I am currently in the process of fixing the old code. Feel free to make a pull request with your updates if you have and improvements for the code. Json/db/env files are hidden
